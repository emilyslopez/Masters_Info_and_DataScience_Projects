        Course Description
        This course introduces students to the burgeoning data sciences landscape,
        with a particular focus on learning how to apply data science techniques to uncover,
        enrich, and answer the questions you will encounter and originate in the industry. After
        an introduction to data science and an overview of the course, students will explore decision
        making in organizations and the emerging role of big data in guiding both tactical and strategic decisions.
        Lectures, readings, discussions, and assignments will teach how to apply disciplined, creative methods to 
        ask better questions, gather data, interpret results, and convey findings to various audiences in ways that
        change minds and change behaviors. The emphasis throughout is on making practical contributions to real decisions
        that organizations will and should make. Some of the industries and domains that we will explore include finance,
        energy, journalism, intelligence, health care, politics, agriculture, e-commerce, and technology.
