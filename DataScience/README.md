        Course Description
        This course is a fast-paced introduction to computer programming tailored to the needs of data science professionals. 
        It uses Python as its main language and incorporates frequent coding exercises to build each studentâ€™s capabilities. 
        The course begins by introducing foundational Python objects, then explains how these are combined to form useful functions and classes. 
        The first of two projects is an object-oriented exercise, giving students insight into how large-scale software systems are developed. 
        The last section of the course is devoted to two popular Python packages for data analysis, NumPy and pandas. The final project consists of a data analysis, 
        giving students the chance to explore a dataset of their own choosing. Aside from Python, the course also spends time on several other technologies that are 
        fundamental to the modern practice of data science, including the command line, Jupyter notebooks, and source control with Git and GitHub.
        
        Course Goals and Objectives
        By the completion of this course, students will be able to:
        
        Navigate a file system, manipulate files, and execute programs using a command line interface
        Understand how to manage different versions of a project using Git and how to collaborate with others using Github
        Be fluent in Python syntax and familiar with foundational Python object types
        Be able to design, reason about, and implement algorithms for solving computational problems
        Understand the principles of object-oriented design and the process by which large pieces of software are developed
        Be able to test and effectively debug programs
        Know how to use Python to extract data from different types of files and other sources
        Understand the principles of functional programming
        Know how to read, manipulate, describe, and visualize data using the NumPy and pandas packages
        Be able to generate an exploratory analysis of a data set using Python
