    "Design two classes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Please create a class called **PlayingCard**. (20 points)<br>\n",
    "This class should have: <br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"rank\" that takes a value of \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\", or \"A\"<br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"suit\" that takes a value of \"♠\" \"♥\" \"♦\" or \"♣\". (If you don't know how to make these characters you can cut and paste from this block)<br>  \n",
    "- An __init__ method that:\n",
    "    -  Accepts as parameters a specific rank (as a string) and suit (as a string).\n",
    "    -  **Raise a TypeError** with \"Invalid rank!\" or \"Invalid suit!\" when a rank or suit is not valid.\n",
    "- The ```__str__``` and ```__repr__``` methods to display the cards correctly (as shown below in the examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Please create a class called **Deck**. (30 points)<br>\n",
    "This class should have: <br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"cards\", that holds a list of PlayingCard objects. <br>\n",
    "- An __init__ method that: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - By default stores a full deck of 52 playing card (with proper numbers and suits) in the \"cards\" list. Each cards will be  of the class PlayingCard above<br>\n",
    "    - Allows the user to specify a specific suit of the 4 (\"♠\" \"♥\" \"♦\" or \"♣\"). In this case, the program should only populate the deck with the 13 cards of that suit.\n",
    "    - After the cards object is initialized, call the \"shuffle_deck()\" function (below).<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- A \"shuffle_deck()\" method that randomly changes the order of cards in the deck.<br>\n",
    "    - Import the random library to 'shuffle' the deck: https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/random.html#random.shuffle\n",
    "    - Please import it at the top of your block instead of inside the class / methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"deal_card(card_count)\" method that:\n",
    "    - **Removes** the first `card_count` cards from the deck and **returns** them as a **list**.<br>\n",
    "    - If the deck doesnt have the `card_count` number of cards left to deal, **return** the message `Cannot deal <x> cards. The deck only has <y> cards left!` (do not raise an exception or print inside the method).\n",
