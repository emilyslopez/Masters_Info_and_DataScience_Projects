    "## Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand PEP 8 standards\n",
    "- Use all of your previously gained knowledge together on a single program\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to import a user-made module and function into python from another .py file\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to refine an algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task:\n",
    "Write a Python program that takes a Scrabble rack as a function argument and prints all \"valid Scrabble English\" words that can be constructed from that rack, along with their Scrabble scores, sorted by score. \"valid Scrabble English\" words are provided in the data source below. A Scrabble rack is made up of 2 to 7 characters.\n",

    "## Modules in this Program:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Module 1: wordscore.py\n",
    "\n",
    "`valid_words_list`\n",
    "1) Takes the input letters from `run_scrabble`, named rack\n",
    "2) For each word in `data` (sowpods.txt), checks if all of the letters in the word are present in the input rack. If they are all letters \n",
    "in the rack, we add the word to our list of valid words\n",
    "3) Returns list of all valid words\n",
    "\n",
    "`score_word` \n",
    "1) Takes in a word. We get the value for each letter using the `scores` dictionary (ex: scores[letter]) and add that value to the total score for the word\n",
    "2) Returns a tuple of the score for the word and the word itself: (word score, word)\n",
    "\n",
    "`words_scores_list`\n",
    "1) Applies `score_word` to the list of valid words that `valid_words_list` returns\n",
    "2) Creates a list of (word score, word) tuples for each valid word. Sorts the list by score value first, then by alphabetical order\n",
    "2) Returns  and the length of the list as a tuple: (word list, list length)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Module 2:  scrabble.py\n",
    "\n",
    "`run_scrabble`\n",
    "1) Import `wordscore.py` and call `score_word` function\n",
    "2) Takes 2-7 letters A-Z (upper or lower case) or up to two wild cards ( `*` or `?`. one of each character: one `*` and one `?)\n",
    "3) Convert all letters to uppercase since output is in upper\n",
    "4) Does error check and returns info to user\n",
    "    * Do not restrict number of same letters\n",
    "    * Check that amount of input tiles is within 2-7/length of rack is between 2-7\n",
    "    * Check that the input does not have more than one * or ? (can have max one and one)\n"
